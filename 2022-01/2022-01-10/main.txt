This one is a little more theory than programming. I am sure that I could whip
something up but the time investment is a lot greater than I want to commit to
for these programming challenges. 

I think the simple way is to look at RAID as a solution but instead for looking 
for errors or faults it will detect changes. Now this can be broken down evern 
more, with normal data storage they are broken down into blocks so you can 
compare hashes of the files blocks and then use the hash to repair/update the 
file that is old.
