Unfortunatly since I normally work in python and my computer is not set up for 
languages that use pointer I will try and pseudocode this out. 

the xor value is an xor of next and prev

Things you need to know, a NULL pointer is all 0s

you know the locations of head and tail at any given time


in python XOR is ^
id function in python get the mem address

Actually now that I have researched a few python mem features, i'll give it a 
stabS

cant use None as null memory locations need to use 0


had to look up actualy functions for get_pointer and dereference_pointer but 
they are __type_cast and id respectively.


Alright take away for this one is that they want you to know the terms exlusive
or and linked list and what both entail.

I struggled a little bit with the syntax but thats to be expected wince this was
my first time diving into pointer programing in Python which isn't really a 
thing. I think that if I was able to use the pseudo code I could have solved it 
a bit quicker.
